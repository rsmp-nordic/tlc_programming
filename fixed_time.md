# Fixed Time Program
A fixed time program is a basic form of control strategy which define a fixed cycle length and a fixed schedule of when signal groops change. There is no use of detectors and each cycle is exactly the same.

## Prerequisites
Running a fixed time program depends on regional, controller and intersection [configurations](configurations.md), which are defined outside the
signal program.

Specifically, signal groups and the conflict matrix are defines in the intersection configurarion, not in the signal program.

Similary, regional settings like red-yellow time is defined in the regional/controller/intersection configuration, not in the signal program.

## Structure
A fixed-time program defines a cycle length and the transitions:

```yaml
length: 60
offset: 0
groups: ["a1","a2","b1","b2"]
states:
  0:    "00AA"
  2.5:  "11AA"
  30:   "AA00"
  34:   "AA11"
```

- `length` defines the cycle length in seconds. Must be positive. When this time is reached, the program starts over.
- `offset` defines the cycle offset in seconds. Must be in the range 0..length.
- `groups` is an ordered lists of signal groups. Must match the actual groups
- `states` is a hash of signal states, with keys indicating the time in seconds and the representing the state of all groups.
  Each character in the string represent the state of a signal group;
  the first character corresponds to the first group in the `groups` list,
  the second characater to the second item, etc. The allowed state values are explained below.
  The string must specify the state of all groups, ie. the length must be equal to the number of items in `groups`.

The above program is for a simple four-legged interesection with A and B directions. The intersection has four singal groups; a1, a2, b1 and b2. The A direction is green for the first 30s and the B direction is green (1) for the last 30s, with some red-yellow (0) transitions in between:

```
a1  |011111111111111AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|
a2  |011111111111111AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|
b1  |AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA001111111111111|
b2  |AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA001111111111111|
    0s              30s            60s
```

## States
Avaiable states:

- a: Disabled, dark
- 0: Red-yellow
- 1: Minimum green
- A: Red rest without start order

(These states are taken from https://rsmp-nordic.github.io/rsmp_sxl_traffic_lights/1.2.1/signal_group_status.html)

## Failures
You are responsible for making sure the appropriate safety times, etc. are respected.
If running a program results in conflict or inconsistencies, a fault will occur.

Depending on the configuration of the controller, a fault can lead e.g. dark mode, yellow flah or switch to a fault program.

To avoid failures, programs should be validated using a suitable simulator or test tool before deployment.
